On a regular basis EA and Phenomic studios launch new patches that break these extensions so they need to be fixed. \r\n\r\nTry a [search for LoU BoS on userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/search?q=LOU+BOS&submit=Search) and you'll see plenty of customized versions fixing various issues. I'm offering an alternative by hosting the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConanLoxley/lou-extensions) where anyone can directly push fixes directly in the source code.\r\n\r\n###Install lou-extensions\r\n\r\n![google chrome logo](http://conanloxley.github.com/lou-extensions/images/chrome.gif)  \r\nGoogle Chrome version 18 or higher:  \r\n[install lou-extension version 0.4.0 for Chrome](http://conanloxley.github.com/lou-extensions/release/lou-extensions.crx)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Greasemonkey logo](http://conanloxley.github.com/lou-extensions/images/greasemonkey.jpg)  \r\nGreasemonkey 0.9.16 or higher:  \r\n[install lou-extension version 0.4.0 for Greasemonkey](http://conanloxley.github.com/lou-extensions/release/greasemonkey.user.js)","google":"","name":"Lou-extensions"}
